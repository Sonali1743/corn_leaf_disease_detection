# Identifying Diseases in Corn Plant Leaves from Images: With 94% Accuracy

By: Sonali Agrawal

## Objective

The aim of this project is to identify whether corn plants are healthy or diseased by analyzing images of their leaves. We have built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to achieve our aim. CNN is a powerful type of deep neural network that extracts features from images to perform tasks like image classification. Our model has been trained using a dataset of categorized corn leaf images, including Healthy, Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, and Blight.

Given that the US is the world's largest producer, consumer, and exporter of corn, with approximately 90 million acres planted each year, it is crucial to monitor corn fields for signs of disease. Corn is the primary feed grain in the U.S., accounting for over 95% of total feed grain production and use, according to the [US Department of Agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn-and-other-feed-grains/feed-grains-sector-at-a-glance/).

Our model enables corn farmers to effectively monitor their fields and detect disease symptoms as soon as they appear on plant leaves. By promptly identifying issues, farmers can take appropriate measures to address them. This technology provides a valuable tool for minimizing crop losses, improving productivity, and optimizing resources.

In summary, our CNN model empowers corn farmers to monitor their fields and swiftly detect disease symptoms on corn leaves. This enables timely interventions and appropriate actions to protect and maintain healthy corn crops.

## Data Access

We have downloaded the image dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset). The dataset has total 4188 corn plant leaf images:

- Common Rust - 1306 images
- Gray Leaf Spot - 574 images
- Blight - 1146 images
- Healthy - 1162 images
